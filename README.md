# Multi-Classification-Task

### I will discover how can use Keras to develop and evaluate neural network models for multi-class classification problems.

##### we will completing this steps step-by-step:

• How to load data from CSV and make it available to Keras.

• How to prepare multi-class classification data for modeling with neural networks.

• How to evaluate Keras neural network models with scikit-learn.
